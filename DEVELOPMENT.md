## Development

We need to clone the project and prepare the dev environment:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/punidramesh/Hades.git // or using ssh: git@github.com:punidramesh/Hades.git
$ cd Hades
$ pip install -e .
```

This will install all requirements to use `Hades`. You may want to create a virtual environment specifically for this.

To install development dependencies, run:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
